This is a tiny folder for tinkering with the vTiger webservices API

putting it out there for other persons to benefit

So far I've created a file that demos how to interact with the webservices API
using Python

Working with vtigerauthdemo.py
-------------------------------

This is more of a code snippet to demonstrate what's possible. In order to test it you'll need to change some of the lines including.
The values you'll need to change include the following:

accessKey - In order to use log into your vtiger server 
       and go to 'preferences' > 'user advanced options'.
       This is used instead of a password.

vtigerserver - the address of the vTiger server

username - user name for authentication (more than likely 'admin').
